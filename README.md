# ants
This program takes a graph (rooms with un-directed connections) and computes the most efficient way to move N ants from source node to sink node, outputs an animated movement of the ants

This project was done in collaboration with Liam Dehaudt at 42.

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Currently only tested on OS X.

Run with `./ants "Filename"`.
A collection of sample ant farms is included in `farms/` folder.
